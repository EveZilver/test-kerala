    <h1>IDUKKI</h1>
    <p>Idukki, a landlocked district of Kerala, is one of the most nature-rich areas in Kerala with more than half of the area covered with forest. This rugged hill resort is known for its wildlife sanctuaries, beautiful bungalows, tea factories, rubber plantations and forests.

        Idukki's speciality lies in 650 feet long and 550 feet high arch dam across the Kuravan Kurathi mountain, which is the largest in the country. Anamudi, which is the highest peak in India, south of the Himalayas, is also located in Idukki. Idukki is one of the districts in the state that has abundant scope for promotion of eco-tourism if proper infrastructure and promotional activities are provided.</p>

          <h1>MEESAPULIMALA</h1>
          <div class="carousel-text">
          <p>Perched at a height of 2640 meters above the sea level, Meesapulimala is the second highest peak when it comes to the mountain ranges in the Western Ghat. This mountain range is a trekkerâ€™s paradise in the Southern parts of India, and is located just a small distance away from the beautiful Munnar town of Idukki district in Kerala. The name of the peak is derived from the fact that it is made of a total of eight peaks. All of these mountains are spread out and have a moustache like formation. The mountain range is sandwiched between Anaimalai Hills and the Palani Hills, which are located near Suryanelli. 

            The beauty of the mountain range can only be fully appreciated  if you trek to the top of the mountain. To that end, first, you have to take a jeep to the base camp and then hike to the top of the mountain. However, this route should only be undertaken by veteran hiking enthusiasts, as it can be quite grueling. Most of the travelers prefer to undertake an easier trek from Rhodovalley to Meesapulimala, which is 8 km long. You can also hike to the mountains from Silent Valley, which is located 6 km away from Rhodo Valley.</p>
