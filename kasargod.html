          <h1>CHANDRAGIRI FORT</h1>
          <div class="carousel-text">
              <P>
                Built in the 17th century by Shivappa Nayak of Bedanoor, the Chandragiri Fort belongs to the chain of forts built by the same ruler. The fort is ten kilometers away from Bekal. The eventful history of the fort goes like this. The river Chandragiri was earlier considered to be the border of the two powerful kingdoms â€“ Kolathunadu and Thulunadu. When Thulunadu was captured by the Vijayanagara Empire, the Kolathunadu kings lost the Chandragiri region to them. During the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire the area was administratively looked after by the Keladi Nayakas of Ikkeri. In 16th century the Vijayanagara Empire fell and Vengappa Nayaka declared independence. Later Shivappa Nayak took over the reins. He built a chain of forts of which Chandragiri is part. This large fort is 150 feet above sea level and offers an astonishing view of the Chandragiri River and the Arabian Sea.

          <H1>BEKAL FORT</H1>
          <div class="carousel-text">
              <P>
                Around 16 km to the south of northernmost district in Kerala, Kasaragod, lies the massive Bekal Fort. It is among the biggest forts in Kerala and has been impeccably maintained throughout the years. It rises to 130 feet above sea level and is situated on a headland spanning 35km. Much effort has been put to develop a beautiful beach here called the Bekal Fort Beach. People flock to these spots in great numbers. Situated comfortably on steep hills by the sea, the fort provides for an imposing view from the beach. Built using laterite slabs and with a polygonal shape, it is amongst the most visited sites in Kerala.

                There are many factors that have added to the popularity of the site. An observation tower fitted with beautiful peepholes, the Anjaneya Temple with its famous masonry and two Theyyam sculptures built from laterite are among the primary attractions. An ancient mosque built by Tipu Sultan and various underground passageways are also important places in the area. A rock garden was built using laterite in the parking area and is an architectural marvel in itself. Trees have been planted on the beach along with the construction of a splendid walkway which makes it easier to traverse the beach and enjoy its sights. At night, the entire place is lit up with special lights that add a whole new dimension to its beauty
