          <div class="carousel-text">
          <p>Thunchan Parambu or Thunchan Memorial Trust and Research Centre is the birthplace of Thunchath Ezhuthachan, the father of Malayalam language. In his own distinctive poetic style, Ezhuthachan rendered the stories of great epics such as the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. 

            The Thunchan Memorial Trust has a Saraswathi Manadapam, a granite structure, an auditorium with a seating capacity of 500, an open-air stage, cottages for guests, a dormitory, a dining hall and two ponds. 
                                 
            The National Manuscript Mission has designated Thunchan Memorial Trust as its Manuscript Resource Centre to survey, document and electronically report manuscripts of North Kerala. 
            
            The Literary Museum is a favourite among visitors to the centre. Set up in October 2008, the museum is one of its kind in any Indian language. The museum depicts the evolution of the Malayalam language and literature through visual clippings, soundtracks, paintings and photographs.
            
            The Thunchan festival, held annually during the first week of February, is a major cultural event in the country. It is also the time when the whole town of Tirur gets immersed in the festival. The five-day festival is attended by eminent writers and scholars. Literary seminars, poetry reading sessions, cultural discourses, dance and music performances are the highlights of the festival. Hordes of people line up along the streets of the town when the iron stylus with which Ezhuthachan wrote his poems is taken out in a grand procession.

          <H1>TEAK MUSEUM</H1>
          <div class="carousel-text">
              <P>Kerala has had a long association with teak and has always played a central role in its cultivation and trade. The word teak itself is said to have come from the Malayalam word 'theku'. The Teak Museum in Nilambur celebrates this ancient relationship and takes one on a special journey through history, chronicling teak and its importance in our culture.

                Teak is still the most sought after form of timber. The museum was made of the sub-centre of Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI) in 1995. Teak is extremely significant in the area. The world's first Teak (Tectonagrandis) plantation was raised in Nilambur way back in the 1840s and is among the premier teak plantations in the world. Visitors come here in large numbers and are greeted by the extensive root system of a 55-year-old teak tree in the portico.
                
                The ground floor of the facility is dedicated to research on the Kannimara Teak. The teak plantation nearby is host to this great tree which is the oldest of its kind in the world. It is an integral part of the region’s history and we get a detailed account of the bark, flower and fruit of the teak. We alsocatch a glimpse into the teak plantation activities undertaken 160 years ago. Some of the other attractions here are the traditional granary and a miniature model of a sailing vessel called Uru, made of teak wood.
                
                Here, one can also find the large stump of a 480-year-old teak tree brought from Nagarampara Forest Range in Kottayam division. 
                
                There are a variety of birds and reptiles in the 800 m long bio-resources natural trail. </P>
