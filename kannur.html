    <h1>KANNUR</h1>
    <p>Kannur is a coastal city in the south Indian state of Kerala. It was once an ancient trading port. Enduring monuments such as 16th-century St. Angelo Fort, once occupied by European colonial forces, show the city’s significant role in the spice trade. Housed in a former palace, the Arakkal Museum highlights Kerala's one Muslim royal family. The palm-fringed sands of Payyambalam Beach run along Kannur’s western shore.</p>

            The Muzzhapilangad Drive-in Beach at Kannur is one referred to with many superlatives- as the longest drive-in beach in the whole of India, as one of the cleanest beaches of Kannur and most importantly, as one of the best drive-in beaches that the entire Asian continent has to offer!
            
            Being Kerala's only drive-in beach, it attracts the attention of many tourists around the year. The whole concept of drive-in beaches is that you can drive right on the sandy shores of the beach- it is not very often that you get to drive along a 4 km long shoreline that offers an open road with no traffic and a stunning view.
            
            Treat the adrenaline junkie in you and go out for some paragliding, parasailing, powerboating and many other water sports. The Muzzhapilangad Drive-In Beach is the perfect weekend getaway to blow off some steam and spend quality time with your loved ones.

          <h1>ST ANGELO FORT</h1>
          <div class="carousel-text">
              <P>

                St Angelos Fort is definitely one of the most popular and frequently visited attractions of Kannur and for more reasons than one. The polished yet prehistoric structure of this fortress oozes with unadulterated elegance and overwhelming power. Standing ashore in the Arabian sea, St Angelos Fort enjoys a panoramic and unobstructed view of the diorama created by the merger of the magnetic waves and the azure waters. It also overlooks the mesmerising Mopilla Bay, a natural harbour.
                
                St Angelos Fort is mainly famous for the gripping history and the intriguing tales it has to tell. This fort was a point of interest for many dynasties of domestic as well as the international origin and has seen many bitter battles in the quest to conquer it. The Portuguese Viceroy, Dom Francisco de Almeida had imprisoned his successor, Alfonso de Albuquerque because he did not want to give up the reins of his power. This led to a series of bitter events and conspiracies that have been etched in the history of Portugal as well as Kannur forever. Walking around the walls of this majestic fort, you can almost picture the battles that this fortress has seen. There are tombstones of the soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the fort, barracks and an old chapel here that you can explore. Kannur's first ever lighthouse also stands next to the fort and adds to its already hypnotic glory.

          <H1>KANNUR LIGHT HOUSE</H1>
          <div class="carousel-text">
              <P>

                Being Kerala's first lighthouse ever and Kannur's only one, the Kannur Lighthouse is a pretty big deal. Standing tall at the height of 75 feet, this lighthouse was first built in the early months of 1903. This cylindrical concrete tower has managed to withstand the attacks of the Arabian Sea and has been fully functional for over a century. The Kannur Lighthouse has a balcony with a light that is lit as the evening breaks in to alert the seamen of the land. Treat the history buff in you and visit this site to be impressed by its fascinating history, fall in love with its mesmerising backdrop and be delighted by the impeccable view.
                
                Since the lighthouse stands at a considerable height, one is delighted with an enchanting and panoramic view of the entire city of Kannur, the limitless Arabian Sea, the Baby Beach and even parts of Payyaballam Beach. Going up the spiral staircase of this lighthouse, you are introduced to a variety of ancient navigational equipment whose immaculate engineering and impeccable designs are sure to impress you greatly.
