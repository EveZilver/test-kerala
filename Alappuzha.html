    <h1>ALAPPUZHA</h1>
    <p>Referred to as the Venice of the East, Alappuzha has always enjoyed an important place in the maritime history of Kerala. Today, it is famous for its boat races, backwater holidays, beaches, marine products and coir industry. Alappuzha Beach is a popular picnic spot. The pier, which extends out to the sea here, is over 137 years old. Entertainment facilities at the Vijaya Beach Park add to the attraction of the beach. There is also an old lighthouse nearby which greatly intrigues all visitors.

        Another delightful experience while in Alappuzha is the houseboat cruise. The houseboats you find in the backwaters of Alappuzha are in fact a reworked version of the Kettuvallams of olden times. Kettuvallam is a Malayalam word, ‘Kettu’, refers to dwelling structures and ‘Vallom’ means boat. In the olden days, kettuvallam or boat with thatched roof that covers over wooden hulls was used to carry tons of rice and spices. 
        
        Of late, houseboats come equipped with all the comforts of a good hotel room including furnished bedrooms, modern toilets, cozy living rooms, a kitchen and even a balcony for angling. An uninterrupted view of life in the backwaters can be enjoyed while staying in a houseboat.</p>

          <h1>ALAPPY BACKWATERS</h1>
          <div class="carousel-text">
          <p>The Alleppey backwaters  was earlier used as a mode of transportation, fishing and agriculture and have evolved over time as a tourism hotspot. The main attraction of the Alleppey backwaters is the overnight journey in the famous Kerala houseboats. These houseboats are as comfortable as any hotel room - sometimes even more luxurious, and as a bonus, you get the open deck.

            Sunset viewing, bird watching, village visits, stargazing, witnessing the everyday life of the farmers and fishermen along with visiting the various regions that specialise in the manufacture of certain products like toddy, coir, handicrafts - Alleppey is a handful of an experience to have.
            
            Alleppey is rightfully called the Venice of the East. With its labyrinth of brackish lagoons and interconnected lakes, Alleppey or Alappuzha is no less than the famous European city - neither in beauty nor in history and culture. Hire your boat and get started along the flow of the stream to soak in its beauty.</p>

          <div class="carousel-text">
              <P>The Krishnapuram Palace is a palace and museum that is located in Kayamkulam, at a distance of 47 km from Alappuzha.

The palace is built in the traditional architectural style of Kerala, with a gabled roof, narrow corridors and dormer windows, and is close to the Krishnaswamy Temple at Krishnapuram.

                A major attraction of this place is that it houses is one of the biggest mural paintings that can be found in all of Kerala. Known as the 'Gajendra Moksha', this mural painting covers an area of around 53 square feet and has a rich historical value attached to it. The double-edged sword Kayamkulam Vaal can also be found here. The Krishnapuram Palace is currently maintained by the Archaeological Department of Kerala and contains a variety of exhibits that once belonged to the Palace and its former occupant. </P>

          <div class="carousel-text">
              <P>One of the great delights of the Malabar Coast, the Marari Beach is an idyllic serene beach. About 11 km from the city of Alleppey, this beach is a hotspot for fishing activity, deriving its name from the local fishing village Mararikulam.

                Visiting in August gives tourists the exclusive opportunity to view Snake Boat races across the waters. The serenity and quietude on the beach are beyond description, so much so that Marari Beach has been enlisted among the top five hammock beaches of the world by National Geographic Surve</P>
