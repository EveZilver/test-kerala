          <h1>BANASURASAGAR DAM</h1>
          <div class="carousel-text">
              <P>Another tourist attraction of Kalpetta is Banasura Sagar dam. It is the largest earth dam in India and the second largest of its kind in Asia. The dam is made up of massive stacks of stones and boulders.Situated about 15 km from Kalpetta, the dam holds a large expanse of water and its picturesque beauty is enhanced by the chain of mountains seen on the backdrop.  It is constructed in the Banasura Lake and the nearby mountains are known as Banasura Hills. Legends say that the Asura king of Banasura, (the son of King Mahabali, who is believed to visit Kerala during every Onam festival) undertook a severe penance on the top of these hills and thus it was named after him.  The scenic mountains beckon adventure tourists and the dam site is an ideal starting point for trekking.</P>

          <H1>EDAKKAL CAVES</H1>
          <div class="carousel-text">
              <P>A trip to Edakkal Caves is like a journey into our forgotten past. Located 10 kms from Sulthan Bathery, they have provided historians with great information regarding the lives and habits of our ancestors. The caves are two natural rock formations believed to have been formed by a large split in a huge rock. The carvings inside are extremely beautiful. A trek up the majestic Ambukuthi Hills is required to reach these caves. The aroma of coffee stays with you the entire way. It is truly a surreal experience as we step into the palms of history.</P><P> Nearest railway station: Kozhikode, about 97 km from Sultan Bathery</P>
