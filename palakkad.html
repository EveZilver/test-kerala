          <h1>MALAMBUZHA DAM AND GARDEN</h1>
          <div class="carousel-text">
          <p>Malampuzha Garden in Palakkad district is the only rock-cut garden in South India made by Nek Chand, the renowned artist and winner of the prestigious Padmashree Award. The entire garden is made from broken pieces of bangles, tiles, used plastic cans, tins and other waste materials. Also situated in the gardens is the massive Malampuzha Yakshi (female vampire) built in 1969 by Kanayi Kunhiraman, a greatly respected sculptor from the state. It is a spectacular relic of art that we are lucky to still have with us. The flowering beds, fountains and rose gardens along with an aerial ropeway make it a place that instantly soothes your soul.

            In the lower hills of the Western Ghats lies the beautiful Malampuzha township whose lush greenery and plethora of picnic spots make it a must-visit spot in these areas. It has really good trekking trails that are available to all with a penchant for the same. Malampuzha Gardens and the Irrigation Dam tend to be the areas that attract the highest number of visitors. Apart from being perfect picnic spots, there is a host of interesting trivia surrounding the place that adds to its appeal.

          <H1>PALAKKAD FORT</H1>
          <div class="carousel-text">
              <P>There is an 18th century military base in Palakkad that has many riveting stories to whisper. One of the best-preserved stone-built forts in Kerala, the Palakkad Fort which is often referred as the Tipu Sultan Fort, is one of the major attractions in Palakkad.

                The story goes that Haider Ali rebuilt this medieval fort in 1766. In 1790, the British captured the fort and remodelled it in European style. The entry to this square-shaped fort is from the north east side, via a modern bridge. Once you enter, you face an L-shaped screen wall. It is believed that this construction was meant to safeguard the door from any direct attack. Bastions can be seen at each corner. Ample precautions were taken to protect the doorway from external attacks.  A moat surrounds the fort.
                
                At the main gate, you will see a stucco design, similar to what you will find in temples. In fact, in Kerala, these stucco designs are unique to the Palakkad Fort. A new age wooden doorway has replaced the old one. From the main doorway, you reach a second doorway that leads into the citadel. From the gate, the passage leads to a sub jail.
                
                A walk along the fort will reveal unexpected wonders as you chance upon interesting ancient structures and designs. Another fascinating construction here is the ancient stone step well. A beautifully designed lawn enhances the appearance of the fort but the lawn is open to the public only in the mornings.
                
                The fort is kept alive not only by the tourists but also by the staff of other governmental departments. The fort houses the offices of the Prison and Revenue departments on one side. Another structure houses a museum which displays sculptures and other artefacts found from the premises. For instance, plenty of temple ruins were obtained during a repair work held at the fort.
                
                The fort is a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India.</P>
